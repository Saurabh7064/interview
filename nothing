The HTTP verbs PUT, POST, and PATCH are used to create, update, and modify resources on the server.

Here are the main differences between them:

PUT

Replaces the entire resource at the specified target
The resource is created if it does not exist
The request is idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests will have the same effect as a single request
POST

Creates a new resource
The resource is created as a subordinate of the specified target
The request is not idempotent
PATCH

Modifies the resource at the specified target
The request is not idempotent
In general, you should use POST to create resources and PUT to update them. PATCH is typically used to update a subset of the resource's properties.
